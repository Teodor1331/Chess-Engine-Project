# **Instructions**

The instructions are created based on the condition that you have already done all things
mentioned in the prerequisites file in this folder. First of all you will need to create
your own virtual environment. To do this, write the next command:

```
virtualenv .venv
```

This will create a hidden folder with the name '.venv' - this will be the folder of
the virtual environment itself. After you have install it, you should activate it with:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once you have activated the virtual environment, your should install the needed
requirements to run the project. In order to do that, run the command:

```
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

Then head to the directory Source/ChessModule and run the GameMain.py file with:

```
python3 GameMain.py
```
